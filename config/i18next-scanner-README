Requirements:
npm install -g i18next-scanner

 
Usage:
i18next-scanner.sh has to be run from the frontend directory. All files are configures with the paths relative to it for i18next scanner.

In case all your translations have been overwritten... you ran it from the wrong directory.

Or... you didn't update the configuration correctly after an  update of i18next-scanner. At the time of writing (2023-07-23) the resource save path is relative to the output, whereas the loadpath is relative to the current working directory.
